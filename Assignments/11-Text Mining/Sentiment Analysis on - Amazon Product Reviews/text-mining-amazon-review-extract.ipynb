Here are some of the pros and cons of these headphones:Pros:The sound quality is amazingLong battery backupcompatible with all Bluetooth devices.Can connect two devices simultaneously.Multidevice connecting featureNoise cancellation is amazing.Fast charging takes almost half an hour to charge the battery fully.Last but not least water resistant.Cons:Can cause ear pain in long-time continuous use.Come out from the ear while running or exercising.Sometimes disconnects automatically and again connects automatically.So those were the pros and cons of these boats' Bluetooth earphones. I have been using these earphones for a long time. That was my review, and I hope you will find it helpful. Don't forget to follow for other product reviews.\\n\",\n",

I earlier used apple airpods which automatically switches to device as per need. After using this neckband i am really not missing airpods as this also switches automatically. One star less as the ear buds are little uncomfortable on prolonged use.\\n',\n",

Is it practical? Not at all. I might as well buy an unbranded headphone for 300 that lasts 3 months. Useless product. Don't even buy it.Edit: I wanted to add more to the above feedback. I was upset with this product and went to the twitter page of Boat and made a complaint. I got a response asking me to raise a request on their site. After doing so, they arranged a pick up of the product from my home, got it checked, confirmed that the product is defective and sent me a replacement, which I received today. So, that's my feedback. Their warranty claim process is good. So yes. I may consider buying another Boat in future because of this.\\n\",\n",

Though I have seen other neckband earphones with that design and they are lighter which brings my next problem with the earphones— it's too heavy on my ears and overall.On the good point, In the sound quality, never have BOAT disappointed me so yeah been loving it so far.
