Shokeenism Reviews,"I brought this boat wireless headphones multiple times. The headphones are fantastic and worth the money. Here are some of the pros and cons of these headphones:Pros:The sound quality is amazingLong battery backupcompatible with all Bluetooth devices.Can connect two devices simultaneously.Multidevice connecting featureNoise cancellation is amazing.Fast charging takes almost half an hour to charge the battery fully.Last but not least water resistant.Cons:Can cause ear pain in long-time continuous use.Come out from the ear while running or exercising.Sometimes disconnects automatically and again connects automatically.So those were the pros and cons of these boats' Bluetooth earphones. I have been using these earphones for a long time. That was my review, and I hope you will find it helpful. Don't forget to follow for other product reviews."
Amazon Customer,Overall an excellent product at this price. What i love about it is the dual paring which stays connected to 2 device at the same time. I earlier used apple airpods which automatically switches to device as per need. After using this neckband i am really not missing airpods as this also switches automatically. One star less as the ear buds are little uncomfortable on prolonged use.
Shokeenism Reviews,full marks to sound quality.Dual connectivity is plusMagnets are not that great. it wont pause / play with magnates.too bulky and heavy compare to peers
RK,GOOD PRODUCT BUT EVERYONE CANT BEAR TO USE IN WARM WEATHER N DIPPER AT NIGHT DISTRBING DURING COL
Brijesh Mehta,"I'm writing this review after using the product for 10 mnths,Pros:The bass of the product is really impressive for this budgetYou'll get auto magnetic touch on/off switch.I've used this product during rains and it's still workingThe sound quality is impressive not good as Sony though!!ConsThe speaker of the band while calling gives a  little bit of issue."
Rifuu,overall quality  is nice but bass quality is not much better..price should be less
Promit,Neckband is of good quality. Gives a playback of more than 3 days. Sound quality is better too. You should really go for this one.
Anil Patil,Very good headset at this price range.Connects very quickly and supports dual connection.One problem is that it prompts for all nearby devices to get connected

Puspa Chowdhury,The sound quality is good butThe bass is all it have so if you are a bass lover then it is for youBut if you are buying it for listening during the run or any physical activity then it might be problematic because it's mic part makes right bud pop out of the ear.

Anubhav Tiwari,"I bought this in March 2023. It has already conked off. Agreed, there is a warranty, but to claim it, I have to pay 1000 rupees to an uber guy and apply a day leave from work. Is it practical? Not at all. I might as well buy an unbranded headphone for 300 that lasts 3 months. Useless product. Don't even buy it.Edit: I wanted to add more to the above feedback. I was upset with this product and went to the twitter page of Boat and made a complaint. I got a response asking me to raise a request on their site. After doing so, they arranged a pick up of the product from my home, got it checked, confirmed that the product is defective and sent me a replacement, which I received today. So, that's my feedback. Their warranty claim process is good. So yes. I may consider buying another Boat in future because of this."
Rishi,Mujhe to bhot acha laga boat rockerz 255 pro plus headphones
Mohnish Jain,"the product is great, the reason i gave a 4star is for its connectivity issues. it connects any of the random Bluetooth device or any strange device in the crowded areas. Anybody can connect device to this neckband if its already connected to your phone."
saloni singh,"The wire length and design itself is inconvenient. I cannot walk around freely without those two loops of wire constantly touching/hitting my face.The controller box could be moved to the right end of the neckband. That would be nice I guess but hey I'm just talking a customer experience so idk what you guys had in mind... Though I have seen other neckband earphones with that design and they are lighter which brings my next problem with the earphones‚Äî it's too heavy on my ears and overall.On the good point, In the sound quality, never have BOAT disappointed me so yeah been loving it so far. Battery back is great. Charging is fast."
Amazon Customer,Very like is

Ganesh Prasad bind,Product is good with great sound and quality is also good but it feels heavy in ear because of metal and if you are like bass and wants a long lasting battery so right it is value for money for you
Durga jangid,I don't like this product
Durga jangid,Tan colour becomes dirty soon. Audio quality is good.
Rathesh,"I have been using this for more than 7 months. Sound qualyis awesome. And the best part of it is the battery life. That is tremendous.But while making a call it creates an issue... counterpart cant hear my voice properly and that is not clear. I have verified this with multiple devices as well. So mic is having issue of course. Also the butt gets removed from its place quickly..As a result I have already lost one.However, if you are looking for to listening songs or watching movies only, this is the best for you."

rohan,Working really well for me.
rohan,This earphone is good and perfect if you are searching ofr durable and better sound quality but i would not recommend you if you are finding any boat products as comfortable and about boat 255 pro plus  it always slips off if you have small  and oily ears even with ear hooks it won't settles in my ears and the neckband wire length is too small it will be frustrating if you have long neck or long height person to carry those neckband batteries with your ears
